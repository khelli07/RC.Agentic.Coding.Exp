### Skills

[TODO: what is skills?]

## Process

Tools: Codex, OPSX

1. I ask it to create skills for rocket chat, ask it to explore document online and node_modules\@rocket.chat. Basically I converse with it, force it to create skills needed to create apps engine. I specify every URL documentation in rocketchat, including the deployment.

2. I use openspec. This will help the AI to define the spec. Basically, we are doing SDD (spec driven development)

# My Exploration

## Brainstorm

Basically the first thing I do is to ask it to brainstorm (tbh I don't really know what to build as an example!).

```
Let's brainstorm a bit. I want to make some app that connect to an API, then I want to register like a slash command to query it. What kind of API can I make? OR do you have other ideas?
```

I converse with it for some time, then I got this idea that I think it's simple but funny enough as well.

```
• Good pick. /dadjoke is a clean first feature and fun to demo.

  I can implement it now in app/rctutorial with:

  - slash command /dadjoke
  - HTTP call to icanhazdadjoke.com (JSON)
  - friendly error fallback message

  If you want, I’ll start wiring it up now.
```

P.S. I forget that you can use `/opsx:explore` to brainstorm ideas more structurally!

## Start implementing

Use OPSX pipeline

- `/opsx:new` -> Create a slashcommand /joke to generate a joke. Determine the argument based on the HTTP API.

- `/opsx:ff` -> Create all the artifacs, e.g. design, proposal, tasks (this is autogenerated!)

- `/opsx:apply` -> Review the plan, after that, execute this

Then, you can ask it to deploy using docker!
