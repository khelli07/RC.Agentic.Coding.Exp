Setup:

1. I ask it to create skills for rocket chat, ask it to explore document online and node_modules\@rocket.chat. Basically I converse with it, force it to create skills needed to create apps engine. I specify every URL documentation in rocketchat, including the deployment.

2. I use openspec. This will help the AI to define the spec. Basically, we are doing SDD (spec driven development)

Project:
